Old One's Army monsters will now give 60% of their exp on all game modes except on Free Mode.
Krampus Kidnapper now has a chance of appearing for those who did naughty deeds.
	The game will let you know the nights Krampus Kidnapper will show up.
	Differently from the original Krampus, this one is quite stealthy.
	It will begin showing up if:
		You killed Queen Bee, or start Hardmode (killed the Guide).
	It will primarily hunt the closest player to it.
		Hunted players that are hurt by it will receive the Terrified debuff, which greatly reduces mobility and attack power.
		If a player is captured by it, the monster will despawn as the captured player despawns.
	It will allow you early access to a number of items you would get only from Frost Moon events, they include:
		Christmas Hook, Reindeer Bells and Baby Grinch Mischief Whistle.
		And for joke's sake... Naughty Present.
