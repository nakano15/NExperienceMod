Changed how Knockback Power is calculated on Classic and Ascension RPG Modes.
Added 1 HP Mode.
	1 HP Mode will cap your character max health at 1 when enabled.
	The setting is individual, so the player who enables it will have the health capped.
	Upon disabling the game mode, the character health will be set to 1, and there will be a 30 seconds potion sickness, so be careful of where you disable the setting.
